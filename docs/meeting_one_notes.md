Quick recap
Shane and Mushood discussed implementing a hierarchical search system for a network application, focusing on database structure and optimization for tracking user relationships and upline paths. They reviewed various system requirements including user management, network join requests, and evangelism tool features, with Mushood explaining the implementation of these capabilities in the codebase. The conversation ended with a discussion about QR code functionality for user onboarding and potential changes to the payment model, though funding constraints were noted as an obstacle for some proposals.
Next steps
- Mushood: Reverify the functionality of the "view pending network join requests" and related approval/denial features in the current system.
- Mushood: Add the ability for users to adjust their preferred contact method after sign-up, not just during sign-up.
- Mushood: Add functionality so that super admin (and potentially other admins) can change upline and downline IDs for users.
- Mushood: Ensure that only up to the fourth generation of a user's network is displayed, with a numeric indicator for the total network size beyond the fourth generation.
- Mushood: Add a UI component to the dashboard to display the user's current progress and next step in their discipleship journey.
- Mushood: Remove or update the "system is able to display journey steps with visual indicators (outline, colored, locked)" requirement to reflect the ROYGBIV color progression and partial/complete status as described.
- Mushood: Remove the "system is able to calculate decisions as 10% of gospel shares" requirement, as it misrepresents the intended logic (both shares and decisions targets must be met for full completion).
- Mushood: Ensure that when a new believer/disciple is added via the gospel tab, they are automatically sent an SMS/email with a pre-filled sign-up link based on their communication preference.
- Mushood: Implement QR code generation for each user, with options for the user to select the default role (e.g., new believer, sharer, crusade role) that new sign-ups will be assigned when scanning their QR code.
- Mushood: For crusade organizers, implement a default QR code mode that allows new sign-ups to choose their role (volunteer, church, new believer, etc.) after scanning.
- Mushood: Remove the "record prayer requests" feature from the requirements if not needed at this stage.
- Mushood: Investigate and fix non-functional buttons in the crusade/volunteer tabs as reported during the meeting.
- Mushood: Schedule and attend the follow-up meeting tomorrow at the same time to complete review of the remaining functional requirements and use cases.
- Mushood/Desmond: Provide an update on what can be delivered within the current budget and outline next steps for project funding and milestone planning in the next meeting.
Summary
Hierarchical Search System Implementation
Shane and Mushood discussed the implementation of a hierarchical search system for a network application. Mushood explained that in a NoSQL architecture, complex upline paths are not necessary due to the lack of linked data and unique identifiers. Instead, a relational database with indexed attributes can efficiently handle searches and display network relationships. They agreed that a dedicated table for network members, with unique IDs and parent IDs, would be sufficient to track user relationships and generate hierarchical search results.
Database Structure and User Relationships
Mushood explained the database structure to Shane, focusing on how user relationships are stored as attributes rather than actions. He demonstrated that by storing user relationships as properties, the system can efficiently search for uplines and downlines without scanning the entire database. They then began discussing functional requirements, starting with a review of database entities, particularly the user entity. Shane noted that Mushood had manually reviewed the entire codebase to understand the application's current functionality.
Database Optimization for Upline Tracking
Mushood and Shane discussed the optimization of a database structure for tracking user upline paths. Mushood explained his approach of creating a separate table with indexes to efficiently store and retrieve upline relations, which significantly reduces search time compared to the previous method. Shane inquired about handling long user hierarchies, and Mushood clarified how the path order system works to reduce the number of searches needed. They also discussed the workflow for creating user accounts, including how to handle cases where users join without an invitation, with Shane confirming that a default upline ID can be set for such cases.
User Management System Database Schema
Mushood presented a detailed database schema for a user management system, explaining tables for user journeys, courses, course units, lessons, and various user roles and interactions. Shane acknowledged the complexity but noted his limited expertise in this domain, suggesting that the schema would be more intuitive once implemented in code. Mushood agreed to convert the schema into code and share it, recommending that Shane use the Gemini API with the Cursor tool for further explanation and understanding.
App Requirements Review Meeting
Shane and Mushood reviewed a requirements document for an app, focusing on user and admin functionalities. They discussed various features like account creation, profile management, contact methods, and account deactivation. Mushood explained that the system uses a relational database, allowing for flexibility in adding or modifying features without breaking the application. They identified that users cannot currently change their preferred contact method after signing up and that the account deactivation feature is not yet implemented. They also discussed the need for an admin to have the ability to modify user roles and upline/downline relationships, with Mushood clarifying that this would be limited to super admins and require separate APIs.
User Management System Review
Shane and Mushood reviewed a document outlining user management and system functionality requirements. They discussed various features including user modes, journey tracking, course management, and network management capabilities. Shane clarified several UI elements and visual indicators, particularly regarding the Roy G. Biv color scheme for journey progress tracking. They confirmed that most features were already implemented in the codebase, though some display issues needed addressing. Mushood noted that the system would automatically update course completion status from the database.
Network Join Request Management
Shane and Mushood discussed network join requests and user permissions in an admin management system. They confirmed that users can view and manage pending network join requests, but agreed that the ability for new users to join another user's network after signup might not be necessary. They also discussed the visibility of generational pipelines, deciding that users should only be able to see up to the fourth generation, with a numeric indicator showing the total network size. Mushood confirmed that various network metrics and statistics features were implemented, including the ability to view network depth and breadth, automatically assign upline relationships, and calculate network statistics.
Evangelism Tool Features Overview
Shane and Mushood discussed the features of an evangelism tool, focusing on its ability to share tools via links or images, log gospel sharing activity with date and location stamps, and record decisions and prayer requests. They clarified that users can add new believers, view personal and network-wide statistics, and track gospel shares and decisions per user. Shane emphasized the importance of automatically sending new believers a pre-filled form link for registration and explained the distinction between new believers and other user types based on the source of their invitation.
QR Code User Onboarding Implementation
Shane and Mushood discussed implementing QR code functionality for user onboarding, where different QR codes would pre-populate user roles based on how they were invited (movement, gospel, or crusade). They agreed that the default role for crusade organizers should be "crusade" with options to choose sub-roles like church or new believer. The meeting was cut short due to time constraints, with Desmond suggesting they continue the discussion in a follow-up meeting the next day. They also briefly discussed the possibility of transitioning from a conference-based payment model to a monthly retainer, though Shane indicated he currently lacks the funding for such an arrangement.
